# AirFoilDesigner
A simple, open source airfoil simulator created with Python and Pygame.
It is (I think, currently, the only airfoil simulator created with Pygame.)
The requirements.txt file should install all dependencies, including Pygame and Python
This is a very simple simulator, everyone is welcome to help, just for fun. It isn't really accurate.
I hope everyone likes it!
